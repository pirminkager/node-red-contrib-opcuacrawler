# node-red-contrib-opcuacrawler
A Node-RED node to crawl through a OPC UA structure using the awesome node-opcua library.
I personally only used it to get the opc ua structure from a siemens s7 cpu which works fine so far.
When testing with the Prosys Simulation server the crawler did not work correctly.
Feel free to contribute.
